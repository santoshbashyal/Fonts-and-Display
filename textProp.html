        This is a text decoration property

    </div>
    <p class="under">This text has a line underneath it.</p>
<p class="over">This text has a line over it.</p>
<p class="line">This text has a line going through it.</p>
<p>
  This <a class="plain" href="#">link will not be underlined</a>, as links
  generally are by default. Be careful when removing the text decoration on
  anchors since users often depend on the underline to denote hyperlinks.
</p>
<p class="underover">This text has lines above <em>and</em> below it.</p>
<p class="thick">
  This text has a really thick purple underline in supporting browsers.
</p>
<p class="blink">
